      <p><br>If there were two words to desrcibe me it would be creativity and perfection. Perfection in a way, I wanted everything in my life to be molded into a certain way I liked. Growing up in the early they say I was already two steps ahead of everyone else, shaped to be multitalented and academically succesful kid, my life revolved around being a high achiever.</br>

<br>People would ask me if I get tired from all the studying and extra curriculars. I shake my head and say no. And so the only coping mechanism I had with the burden to do my best was art. Art was a release, I remembered how as a kid I would always draw anywhere with anything, it didn't matter what medium it was, as long as I was using my creative side and expressing it through shapes and colors.</br> 

<br>So despite the hardships and burnouts I went through for being pushed to be the greatest I can be, I was happy.</p></br>
   
    <div class="w3-content w3-justify w3-text-grey w3-padding-64" id="about">
        <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Things you interest  the most</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p><br>Anything in the creative field to be honest. Something that can express my creativity is something that I always enjoy. I find listening to multiple genres of music interesting, from heavy metal and rock to bubble gum pop and Kpop, you name it, I'm open to trying different genres out there.</br>
<br>Collecting merch from fandoms I am in, seeing little decoratives all over my desk and room is nice to look and makes the room look ten times better and less boring. In addition to that, fashion, dancing, arts, sports and video games are special intrests that I take pride of.</p></br>
      
      <div class="w3-content w3-justify w3-text-grey w3-padding-64" id="about">
        <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">A personality you want to flex about.</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
     <p><br>In reality, I really don't like flexing my personality out to the world, and I would like people to know me slowly. But if there was something to flex about then it would be that I am very observant and empathetic of people's emotions, and that I am quick witted. I can feel people's aura just by looking at them and that I really notice details around public that people don't really pay attention to.</br>
        <br>People who have observed me before tend to say that I am cunning and sly, however it doesn't show since I tend to be very polite with the people around me. With that saying I do take pride of these traits</br>
